Here’s a detailed explanation of the **Longest Common Prefix** problem, including an overview of the provided C++ solution. The goal is to find the longest common prefix string among an array of strings.

### Problem Overview

The task is to find the longest common prefix (LCP) among an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, the function should return an empty string `""`.

### Examples

1. **Example 1**:

   - **Input**: `strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]`
   - **Output**: `"fl"`
   - **Explanation**: The longest common prefix among these strings is `"fl"`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - **Input**: `strs = ["dog", "racecar", "car"]`
   - **Output**: `""`
   - **Explanation**: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

### Constraints

- `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.

### C++ Code Explanation

Here’s the provided code that implements the function to find the longest common prefix:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        if (strs.empty()) return ""; // Handle empty input

        string prefix = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < strs[0].length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = strs[0][i]; // Get character from the first string
            for (int j = 1; j < strs.size(); j++) {
                // If index exceeds current string length or characters do not match
                if (i >= strs[j].length() || strs[j][i] != currentChar) {
                    return prefix; // Return the accumulated prefix
                }
            }
            prefix += currentChar; // Append the character to the prefix
        }
        return prefix; // Return the longest common prefix
    }
};

int main() {
    Solution solution;
    vector<string> strs1 = {"flower", "flow", "flight"};
    vector<string> strs2 = {"dog", "racecar", "car"};

    cout << "Longest Common Prefix of strs1: " << solution.longestCommonPrefix(strs1) << endl; // Output: "fl"
    cout << "Longest Common Prefix of strs2: " << solution.longestCommonPrefix(strs2) << endl; // Output: ""

    return 0;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Input Validation**:

   - The function `longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs)` starts by checking if the input vector `strs` is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string since there are no strings to compare.

2. **Initialize Prefix**:

   - A variable `prefix` is initialized as an empty string. This will store the longest common prefix as it is built.

3. **Character Comparison**:

   - The outer loop iterates over the characters of the first string (`strs[0]`), which serves as the reference for the common prefix.
   - For each character at index `i`, the function retrieves the character (`currentChar`) from the first string.

4. **Inner Loop**:

   - The inner loop iterates over the remaining strings in the array (`strs`).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - If the current index `i` exceeds the length of the current string (`strs[j]`), which means there can't be any more common prefix.
     - If the character at the current index `i` of the current string does not match `currentChar`.

5. **Prefix Accumulation**:

   - If either condition is true, the function returns the current value of `prefix`, as this is the longest common prefix found up to that point.
   - If both conditions are false, it appends `currentChar` to `prefix`.

6. **Final Return**:
   - If the function completes the loops without returning, it returns the fully constructed `prefix`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: **O(m \* n)**, where `m` is the length of the shortest string in `strs` and `n` is the number of strings. In the worst case, each character of each string must be checked.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**, as the space used is not dependent on the size of the input strings, just a few variables.

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently finds the longest common prefix by leveraging the first string as a reference and comparing characters across the other strings in the array. The solution is straightforward and optimal within the constraints provided, ensuring clarity and efficiency.
